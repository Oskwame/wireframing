# 🧩 Wireframing

## 🖋️ Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the structure, layout, and functionality of a digital product such as a website or mobile application. It focuses on the placement of elements on a page without including detailed design components like colors, fonts, or images.

A wireframe acts as the **blueprint** of a design — showing how users will interact with content and navigate through different sections.

## 🎯 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

1. **Clarifies Structure and Functionality**  
   Wireframes help designers and developers visualize how content and features will be arranged before any coding or styling begins.

2. **Improves Collaboration**  
   They allow team members — from designers to developers to stakeholders — to discuss layout and usability early in the project.

3. **Saves Time and Resources**  
   Making changes in the wireframe stage is much faster and cheaper than during the development or high-fidelity design stages.

4. **Focuses on User Experience (UX)**  
   By removing visual distractions, wireframes help teams prioritize usability, flow, and user journey.
